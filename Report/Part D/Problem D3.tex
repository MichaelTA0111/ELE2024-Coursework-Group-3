\subsection{Problem D3}\label{sec:qd3}\hfill

\medskip
\noindent The group was initially unsure whether to use Overleaf (\LaTeX) or LibreOffice Writer as the text editor for the report. After a meeting were we discussed the benefits of both text editors, we decided to use Overleaf (\LaTeX) as it is easier to write equations as well as allowing us to edit the same version of the report at the same time.  

\medskip
\noindent At the beginning of the assignment the communication was not great. The only form of communication was through WhatsApp. We then created a Discord group to allow us to verbally communicate as a group as well as allowing us to stream our screens to help each other fix errors quickly and effectively. This was so successful that we decided to have an average of three meetings a week which led to increased productivity.

\medskip
\noindent We initially used the GitHub Project Board to keep track of who was responsible for each task. However, this feature seemed counterintuitive for some members of our group, so we decided to use the GitHub Issue Tracker instead.
