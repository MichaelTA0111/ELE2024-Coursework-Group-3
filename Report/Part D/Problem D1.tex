\subsection{Problem D1}\label{sec:qd1}\hfill

\medskip
\noindent We decided to start the assignment with a meeting so that tasks could be outlined and designated to be completed for the next meeting. In the meetings we would discuss how to complete a task and then we would assign someone to implement what we discussed about. After each meeting everyone would have a task to complete for the next meeting. The individual tasks were recorded on the GitHub issue tracker. After a task was completed, we would verify the code in the next meeting. We had an average of three meetings per week. The version control used for the assignment was git and the code was stored on GitHub. The link for the issue tracker can be found \href{https://github.com/MichaelTA0111/ELE2024-Coursework-Group-3/issues}{here}.
