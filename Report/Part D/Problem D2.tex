\subsection{Problem D2}\label{sec:qd2}\hfill

\medskip
\noindent We functioned well as a team by:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Providing feedback during meetings about past, current or future tasks.
    \item Using multiple platforms to convey different information i.e. GitHub for sharing code, WhatsApp for general information and Discord for meetings. 
    \item Using Overleaf to allow access to one version of the report which meant everyone could edit the report simultaneously.
    \item Organising tasks using the GitHub Issue Tracker which allowed us to monitor what tasks were still pending completion.
    \item Respecting each other by being punctual for meetings as well as completing tasks on time.
    \item Allowing adequate breaks during the assignment period i.e. taking a break for Christmas week.
    \item Having our own group name, 'German Double S', increased team morale and a created a sense of belonging.
\end{itemize}
